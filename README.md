After they mate, a new offspring of the same type is produced and added to the game. The child is at age 0, of weight 0, gender and location is decided randomly, and acts normally.
8. The immoral zookeeper sometimes go hunting in the zoo. If he can shoot a chicken of weight greater than 10, he eats the chicken. Hunting happens randomly at every cycle.
